# Planetary Starkiller

Starkiller is a 3D printed file that allows a Gobilda Yellow Jacket 84 RPM motor to transform to any of the following speeds: 6000 RPM, 1620 RPM, 1150 RPM, 435 RPM, 312 RPM. It works by replacing parts of the planetary gearbox with fixed stages. 

The system also fits any other planetary gearbox from gobilda (not neccessarily the 84 RPM one) but we have selected the 84 RPM motor as the main focus because its planetary configuration can produce most of the other options.
